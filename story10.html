        Gilgamesh has fulfilled the destiny Enlil gave him. He became a great king who did not oppress his people, and is remembered for all time because of the city he built and the journey that he made and recorded on tablets. When he dies, his family and his people mourn him. They make offerings to the gods on his behalf, and the offerings read Gilgamesh in his tomb.
