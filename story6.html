        Utnapishtim tells Gilgamesh the story of the flood and how he himself gained immortality. The god Ea warned him that Enlil was sending a flood to wipe out humanity, and instructs Utnapishtim how to build a boat to survive the flood. Utnapishtim takes his family, servants, and animals on the boat. The storm begins, the gods of the dead rise from the abyss, and most human life is wiped out as the other gods mourn. After Utnapishtim and his wife survive the flood, Enil makes them immortal and makes them the guardians of the rivers.
