        Written between 2100 BC and 1200 BC, <em>The Epic of Gilgamesh</em> is one of the oldest and most influential literary works, inspiring classics such as <em> The Illiad </em> and <em> The Odyssey</em>.
        The Mesopotamian epic follows the adventures of the Gilgamesh, the God-King of Uruk. It was inscribed in Cuneiform script in clay tablets recovered and decyphered by archeologists starting in the 1850s.
