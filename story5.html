        Frightened by Enkidu’s death, Gilgamesh goes on a quest to find the secret of immortality. He passes through the gate of the Scorpion Men and travels through total darkness. He emerges in the land of the gods, where Shamash warns him not to cross the sea. Gilgamesh refuses to turn back. At the seaside, he meets Siduri, the goddess of wine, who tells him to live in the present and to stop seeking immortality. But Gilgamesh goes on. He finds the ferryman Urshbabi, and begins his journey across the sea to the home of Utnapishtim.
