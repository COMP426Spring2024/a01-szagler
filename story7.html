        Utnapishtim explains that to become immortal, Gilgamesh must make the gods feel sorry for him. However, Gilgamesh fails the challenge to accomplish this. Utnapishtim then banishes Gilgamesh from the land of the gods, and similarly banishes Urshanabi for bringing a mortal across the sea. Utnapishtim’s wife feels sorry for Gilgamesh, and helps Gilgamesh learn how to find a plant that grants eternal youth. Gilgamesh finds the plant, but later a serpent steals it. Urshanabi and Gilgamesh return to Uruk, where Gilgamesh describes the glories of his city. After his death, Gilgamesh is remembered for building the city’s walls and temple, and for bringing back the story of the flood.
